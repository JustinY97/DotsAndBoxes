Changes:
Make a dialogue fragment if no user picked a color
Make sure no inputted information is lost
Make it so a user can’t tap on an already colored line
Make the current player font bigger — maybe bold
Add a conditional that checks for the case of a tie
Formatting in the winner page may need to be changed since more than one players and needs to be displayed
Make the drop down/spinner options font bigger to match the ones shown 


Feedback:
Pretty easy to use
Looks good
Make the lines easier to click
Maybe populate the colors with default colors

        Starting with an empty grid of dots, players take turns, adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots.<br/><br/>
        A player who completes the fourth side of a 1Ã—1 box earns one point and takes another turn.<br/><br/>
        The game ends when no more lines can be placed. The winner of the game is the player with the most points.
